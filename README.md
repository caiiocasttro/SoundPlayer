# SoundPlayer

## This is a simple application developed to understand a bit more AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer!

### üí° About the project 

SoundPlayer is a simple project developed by me to understand a bit more about how AVAudioPlayer works, how to implement it on the application, and how to use some components of the AVAudioPlayer!

### üßê How it works

The application was developed with two songs and one image for the cover of both of the songs, by clicking on which song, the application pushes a second screen dedicated to the playerView, where you can jump to the next song, back to the last song, control the volume and see the currentTime of the player on the progressView and the both labels underneath the progressView. 

### ‚öíÔ∏è Tools used by me to design and develop this application:

- Xcode
- Swift
- AVFoundation
- AVAudioPlayer
- Figma
